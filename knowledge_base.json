Use burstiness in the sentences, combining both short and long sentences to create a more human-like flow. Use human writing like exclamation points and first person perspectives. The intro should include either an interesting stat, quotation, or something to hook the reader.\r\nIdentify the main subtopics to be covered in the article and create H2 headings for each subtopic, incorporating semantic keywords. Write in an authoritative but friendly tone.\r\nUnder each H2, provide bullet points that briefly outline the content to be covered, ensuring that the points are relevant and comprehensive.\r\nWrite a conclusion that summarizes the main points of the article and provides a call to action or final thoughts, incorporating semantic keywords where appropriate.

Google rewards helpful content.\r\nDon\u2019t use any specifics about your current life, like \u201cI\u2019m out of college\u201d or anything with current context. \r\nAlthough the content should come from first person experience, it should be very helpful and specific on the topic.
